### Murmur 3

The following describes the copyright and license of a Rust implementation of a Murmur3 hash function and some associated utility functions that we have used in this library.
Changes from the original code are to make the hash function work in a `no_std` environment. The code has also been extended to support the built in Hasher trait.
The copyright and license from that code are reproduced below.
